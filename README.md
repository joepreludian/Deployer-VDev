# Deployer-VDev

A simpler way to get things up and Running on Your development machine. 
It's just a vagrant box with a lot of tools bundled.

So far I put the following batteries:
* An Ubuntu Trusty Vagrant base box;
* Nginx environment with PHP-FPM point to **/sites** folder;
* Phpmyadmin;
* RVM with ruby **2.2.0**;
* Python 2.7 with virtualenv and PIP;
* Php Composer;
* Node and NPM;
* Wp-cli;
* And much more I can't remember now!

This repo has a skelecton needed to init the tool and a brief WIKI and Issue tracker.
Hope You Enjoy it!
